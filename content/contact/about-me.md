I am originally from Atlanta, Georgia, and am a proud ramblin' wreck from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). After college, I studied psychology and quantitative methods, receiving my Ph.D. from [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/) (2008). I am now a data scientist and professional educator at [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). Prior to that, I was an Assistant Professor at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/), and an Associate Professor at [Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/).

My [research](https://profiles.impactstory.org/u/0000-0002-8082-1890) focused on health-related applications of Natural Language Processing-based methods, and was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, and Autism Speaks. I have written numerous scientific [publications](/publication) on autism and neurodevelopmental disorders and have presented my research at over 25 international conferences.

While at OHSU, I became an avid user of the statistical programming language R, both in the lab as a Principal Investigator and in the classroom as a professor. I developed a passion for programming and education, and during my tenure at OHSU I developed and taught multiple graduate-level [data science courses](/categories/course/) and [workshops](/categories/workshop/). I also trained the [Office of Research Impact at the Oregon Clinical & Translational Research Institute](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/octri/) to use R, and consulted with the University of Oregon College of Education on the development of a [graduate data science specialization track](https://education.uoregon.edu/). I received an [Excellence in Education award](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/honors-and-awards-ceremony-2018-school-medicine) from OHSU in 2018.
