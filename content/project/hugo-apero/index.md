Apéro (a-pay-ROH) is a Hugo theme for personal websites. It is more than a blog, with flexible custom layouts that help you introduce yourself online. 

## Why apéro?

Apéro is a unique kind of casual get-together in French culture, when you gather with friends and get to know each other better over some apéritifs, snacks, and anything in between. A good apéro is one where you'd happily spend a few hours just hanging out.

I hope this theme helps you create your own virtual apéro. A place where you and your site's visitors enjoy spending time, and one that helps folks get to know you better.
