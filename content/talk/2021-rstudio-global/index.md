“You should have a website!” You may have heard this one before, or even said it yourself. In this workshop, you’ll learn how to build and customize a website from the comfort of the RStudio IDE using the blogdown package. We’ll also cover basic website care and feeding like using R Markdown to create content, and how to use GitHub and Netlify to improve your workflow. Pre-work will be shared with participants ahead of time, but to get the most out of this workshop, you’ll want to have a GitHub account and be able to push and pull files from a GitHub repository using your local RStudio IDE.

The goal of this workshop is to equip participants with tools that amplify their own contributions, build a more visible presence in the R/data community, and share their knowledge and insights with others.
