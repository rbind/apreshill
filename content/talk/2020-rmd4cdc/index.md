R Markdown is an authoring format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents, presentations, and reports from R. It combines the core syntax of markdown with embedded R code chunks that are run so their output can be included in the final document. R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and can be updated whenever underlying R code or data changes.

This is a great opportunity to learn and get inspired about the capabilities for generating reports in R.

This session will introduce flexible and powerful tools for sharing your research and reports, covering topics like:

  *   The basics of R Markdown and knitting
  *   Output formats
  *   Working with data
  *   Adding text
  *   Adding code
  *   Adding tables
  *   Adding plots
  *   Options for sharing R Markdown reports
  
The talk will introduce R Markdown and include an overview of the core content types one can create, such as websites, PDF's, PowerPoints, and more.

No prior knowledge of R or RStudio is needed to attend this session. There is no registration required for this Webinar.
