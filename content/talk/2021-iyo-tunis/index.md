"You should have a website!" You may have heard this one before, or even said it yourself. In this workshop, you’ll learn how to build and customize a website from the comfort of the RStudio IDE with R Markdown. We'll use the blogdown package and the Hugo Apéro theme to build and deploy a personal website. We’ll cover basic website care and feeding like using R Markdown to create content, how to use GitHub for version control and Netlify for publishing, and how to use the latest upgrades to the blogdown R package to keep your site up and running.

The goal of this workshop is to equip participants with tools that amplify their own contributions, build a more visible presence in the R/data community, and share their knowledge and insights with others.
