Inspired by the book “Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear” by Elizabeth Gilbert, Alison will talk about the five essential ingredients needed to creatively learn R and why these elements are also essential for advanced users to take their R skills to the next level. You will hear practical advice for when, where, and how to start a project in R, and how your learning can add value- both to your own knowledge and to contribute to the larger community of R learners. Along the way, she will share recommended resources and evidence-based strategies for project-based learning. Alison’s background working with both new and advanced R users gives her a unique perspective on this topic.
