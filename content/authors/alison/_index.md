I am a data scientist and professional educator. I’m an international keynote speaker, award-winning educator, and co-author of the book [*blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). I love creating online experiences that help people share knowledge and insights with data. I am known for being a compassionate leader and enthusiastic team member, and for making user-facing experiences that both delight and educate.
