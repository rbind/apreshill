  Hi there! Welcome.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a former autism researcher, Associate Professor, and National Institutes of Health-funded Principal Investigator, who transitioned from academic research into data science and now product management. 

I love teaching, and am an award-winning educator with over 13 years of experience. I've developed and led advanced workshops on literate programming and machine learning at conferences like `rstudio::conf`, R / Medicine, and R in Pharma.
